				<h1> User Guide </h1>

			<div class="aboutPara">
			  <p> The CHF Edema Detector uses three components to track your weight and detect edema formation in its early stages. This will prompt you to visit a physician in his/her office before your symptoms worsen, thus avoiding hospitalizations. The set up requires the use of a smartphone--if you do not own or regularly operate a smartphone your emergency contact or family members can carry out these easy-to-follow steps in your home. </p>

					<h2> 1. Weight Scale </h2>
				</div >
			<div class="aboutPara">
			  <p>Start by visiting ifttt.com and sign in using the login details provided. Then download the Withings Health Mate app on your smartphone and sign-in to your account with the login details provided. Proceed to the devices menu and then click on Install a device. Follow the instructions in the app to connect your Nokia Body-BMI Wi-Fi Scale to the app.</p>
			  <p>Step onto the scale on a daily basis and wait for the reading to flash and then stabilize. This indicates that your weight has been taken.</p>
			  <p>More than one user may utilize the same scale every day. For more information on this function please refer to the Nokia Body-BMI Wi-Fi Scale user guide. </p>

				<h2>2. Light </h2>
			</div >
			<h3> Daily Reminders </h3>
			  <div class="aboutPara">
				<p> The LIFX Mini Color light bulb should be connected to any lamp in your home that will be turned on 24/7. After installing the light bulb, turn on the power of the lamp and turn the switch on and off for the light bulb 5 times to activate it. Proceed to download the LIFX app onto your smartphone. Sign in on the app with the login credentials provided and then click the + sign in the top right hand corner to connect your light. Then click on the LIFX Set Up button and follow the steps in the app to connect the light to Wi-Fi. </p>
				<p>Once this has been set up, rename the light bulb with the name provided. </p>
				<p>This light will turn blue every day at 3pm as a reminder for you to step onto the scale. The blue light will subsequently change to regular white light when your weight measurement has been taken--this color-change process will take up to two minutes to occur. To set up a different reminder time please visit ifttt.com and click My Applets. From there click on the applet that says “Every day at 3 pm turn light ON”. This applet will have a settings button on the top right corner which you can click, then scroll down to change the reminder time setting.</p>
				<p><b>The “on/off” controls of your light should only be controlled by the LIFX app. </b></p>
				<p>However, the manual power button on your lamp itself/ light switch in your home must remain “on” at all times. It is recommended that you install this color-changing light bulb in the room that you spend the most amount of time daily. </p>
				</div>
			<h3> Alerts </h3>
			  <div class="aboutPara">
				<p> When we detect an unhealthy weight gain, the light bulb will turn red a few minutes after your most recent weight reading has been taken. This is an indication that you should proceed to make an appointment with a physician. At your doctor’s appointment, you should discuss that your weight has increased abnormally in recent weeks.</p>

				<h2>3. Website </h2>
			</div >
			<div class="aboutPara">
			  <p>This website displays your recent weights in the form of graphs on the Weight Trend tab. If an unhealthy weight trend has been detected, you will also see a red alert warning banner when you sign in to this website. </p>
			  <p>You or your emergency contact will also receive a call from IFTTT to alert you and refer you to this website. </p>
			  <p>This call system can be set up by simply downloading the IFTTT app on your smartphone and signing in with the same credentials you used at <a href="https://ifttt.com">ifttt.com</a>. You will receive calls when you are connected to wifi.</p>
			  <p>You can alert family members, caregivers, and physicians automatically by adding their contact information to the “contacts” page. An automated message alerting them of your unhealthy weight gain will be sent to them in the event that one is detected.  </p>
