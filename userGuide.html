      <h1> User Guide </h1>
        <div class="aboutPara">
          <p> The CHF Edema Detector uses three components track your weight and detect edema formation in its early stages. This will prompt you to visit a physician in his/her office before your symptoms worsen, thus avoiding hospitalizations. </p>

    <h2> Weight Scale </h2>
        <div class="aboutPara">
          <p> Step onto the Nokia Body-BMI Wi-Fi Scale on a daily basis and wait for the reading to flash and then stabilize. This indicates that your weight has been taken. More than one user may utilize the same scale every day. For more information on this function please refer to the Nokia Body-BMI Wi-Fi Scale user guide</p>

    <h2> Light </h2>
        <h3> Daily Reminders </h3>
          <div class="aboutPara">
            <p> The Geeni Prisma 1050 A21 Smart Wi-Fi LED Multicolor Bulb can be connected to any lamp in your home that will turned on 24/7. Downloading the Lifx app is required to control the functions of the light bulb. First, rename your light bulb with the provided name. Then, using the the Geeni Prisma user guide, connect your smartphone/smart device to your light bulb. </p>
            <p> Proceed to the following website on your computer: https://ifttt.com/discover and enter the username and password provided. Then go to the following link: [INSERT LINK HERE] and choose your light bulb name from the “connect to device” drop-down menu. </p>
            <p> The next few options on that page will allow you to set a daily consistent reminder time at which the light bulb will turn blue. This will serve as a reminder for you to step on your scale to take your daily reading. The blue light will subsequently change to regular white light--this colour-change process will take up to two minutes to occur. </p>
            <p> The on/off controls of your light should only be controlled by the app that connects to the Geeni Prisma light bulb. However, the manual power button on your lamp itself/ light switch in your home must remain “on” at all times. It is recommended that you install this colour-changing light bulb in the room that you spend the most amount of time in daily.  </p>
          </div>
        <h3> Alerts </h3>
          <div class="aboutPara">
            <p> When we detect an unhealthy weight gain, the Geeni Prisma light bulb will turn red a few minutes after your most recent weight reading has been taken. This is an indication that you should proceed to making an appointment with a physician. At your doctor’s appointment, you should discuss that your weight has increased abnormally in recent weeks. You will also receive a call from our company… </p>

    <h2> Website </h2>
        <div class="aboutPara">
          <p> This website displays your recent weights in the form of graphs on the Weight Trend tab. If an unhealthy weight trend has been detected, you will also see a red alert warning banner when you sign in to this website. </p>
          <p> You can alert family members, caregivers and physicians automatically by adding their contact information to the “contacts” page. An automated message alerting them of your unhealthy weight gain will be sent to them in the event that one is detected.  </p>
